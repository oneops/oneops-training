Test application details from Murali
 
 Modify the platform variables to specify which artifact to deploy. This example uses the hello-servlet example app. Make sure that the values assigned to these variables do not contain spaces, as this can cause the Tomcat startup script to fail during deployment.
Click on your assembly (be sure you have selected the "design" phase in the top menu). Click on the 'variables' section (below the breadcrumb trail)
Click on 'appVersion'. Edit the variable, change the value to 1.0-SNAPSHOT.
Click on 'artifactId'. Edit the variable, change the value to hello-servlet.
Click on 'groupId'. Edit the variable, change the value to com.walmart.platform.examples.
Click on 'repositoryURL'. Edit the variable, change the value to http://repo.wal-mart.com.
Save your changes and commit them to your design.
